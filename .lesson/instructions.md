Week 2 Assignment #2

Based on what you learned in Weeks 1 and 2, you should be able to do this problem.

General Crates, Inc.(GCI) builds custom-designed wooden crates. With materials and labor, itcosts GCI $0.23 per cubic foot to build a crate. In turn, they charge their customers $0.50 per cubic foot for the crate. You have been asked to write a program that calculates the volume (in cubic feet), cost, customer price, and profit of any crate GCI builds.

Rather than throw you all the way in to solve this problem…unless of course you want to…I will give you a few hints since you are new to programming!

Here are your variables:

Let’s talk about the program design. This is something you should ALWAYS do when you are attempting to solve a problem in programming.

Ask the user to enter the dimensions of the crate (the crate’s length, width, and height).
Calculate the crate’s volume, the cost of building the crate, the customer’s charge, and the profit made.
Display the data calculated in Step 2.

Now I am going to be really nice!! I am going to give you the formulas you will use. In the future, you will have to do the research on this yourself…just like in REAL LIFE!!!

volume = length * width * height
cost = volume * .23
charge = volume * 0.5
Profit = charge - cost

Now use pseudocode to solve the problem! What is pseudocode? In computer science, pseudocode is a plain language description of the steps in an algorithm or another system. Pseudocode often uses structural conventions of a normal programming language, but is intended for human reading rather than machine reading.

Pseudocode for the program is as follows: 

Ask the user to input the crate's length. 
Ask the user to input the crate's width. 
Ask the user to input the crate's height. 
Calculate the crate's volume. 
Calculate the cost of building the crate. 
Calculate the customer's charge for the crate. 
Calculate the profit made from the crate. 
Display the crate's volume. 
Display the cost of building the crate.
Display the customer's charge for the crate. 
Display the profit made from the crate.

Now make the program in Replit!
